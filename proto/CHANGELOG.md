# RAMP Protocol Changelog

## v1.0.0 — Initial release

First public release of the RAMP Protocol (Resource Access Metering Protocol):
the wire format (protobuf under `proto/`), the generated Go and TypeScript SDKs
(under `gen/`), and the specification site (under `website/`). RAMP extends IAB
Tech Lab CoMP v1.0 and RSL 1.0 with resource discovery, transaction execution,
post-usage reporting, dispute resolution, and provider domain verification —
enough for an autonomous agent to negotiate licensed access to a publisher's
resources through an Exchange and produce a cryptographically auditable record of
the transaction.

Highlights: a single `ExchangeService` (`DiscoverResources`,
`ExecuteTransaction`, `ReportUsage`, `DisputeTransaction`, and domain
verification) with Brokers and agents as interchangeable clients; unit-agnostic
metering; Ed25519 at every trust boundary, with RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures
for request and hop authentication and JWS (RFC 7515) for offer and attestation
signatures; a unified `/.well-known/ramp.json` (`WellKnownManifest`) served by
every role with inline RFC 7517 JWKs and explicit key-validity bounds;
cryptographic content attestations with a structured dispute chain; multi-hop
intermediary chains with agent- and exchange-published depth caps; and extension
profiles for domain-specific behavior (news, academic, legal, C2PA, CoMP, pharma,
medical imaging).

**Universal Licensing Core.** A resource carries `repeated LicenseTerm terms`
— the same shape at ingestion (`ResourceEntry.terms`) and emission
(`Offer.terms`) — replacing the hard-coded default pricing and the removed
`AccessRestrictions` / `Offer.restrictions`. A `LicenseTerm` bundles `License`
(`uri`, `id`, `name`, `immutable`), `TermSemantics` (`ENUMERATED` vs
`REFERENCE_ONLY`), `Restriction`s (function / geography / user-type axes),
`Quota`s, `Obligation`s (`scope_license`, `detail`), `Pricing` (required on
every term), Biscuit `scopes`, and `part_label`. `PricingModel` is the closed
charging structure (`FREE`, `PER_UNIT`, `FLAT`); the metering basis moved to
the open `Pricing.unit` vocabulary; `Pricing.metering` was added and
`revshare` / `REVENUE_SHARE` removed (settlement is off-protocol). Every
required enum carries `_UNSPECIFIED = 0` and is rejected if unset
(`PricingMetering` is the deliberate exception — `ONLINE = 0` is its real
default). The Offer JWS signs the entire canonical Offer, so `terms` and
`pricing` are tamper-evident.

**Proto-native vocabulary.** Every open vocabulary axis is defined in the proto
and tooled by buf — no side-car JSON registry. The `(ramp.v1.vocab)` field
option (`FieldOptions` extension 50001) carries the registered bare tokens on
`Pricing.unit` and `Quota.metric`; the `(ramp.v1.vocab_enum)` enum-value option
(`EnumValueOptions` extension 50002, both in `ramp/v1/vocab.proto`) carries the
function / geography / user-type tokens on the `RESTRICTION_KIND_FUNCTION` /
`RESTRICTION_KIND_GEOGRAPHY` / `RESTRICTION_KIND_USER_TYPE` enum values. The
`protoc-gen-rampvocab` buf plugin reads both options structurally and emits
typed Go constants, `All`, and `IsRegistered` per axis under `gen/go/vocab/`
(`pricingunits`, `quotametrics`, `functiontokens`, `geographytokens`,
`usertypes`). Geography registers only the non-ISO specials (`*`, `EU`, `EEA`);
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are structural. `protovalidate` carries the structural
field CELs (`Pricing.unit`, `Quota.metric`) and message-level CEL on `Pricing`
(`PER_UNIT ⇒ unit`, `FREE ⇒ rate 0`). Adding a token edits the option list only
— no message-shape change.

The reasoning behind the major design decisions is recorded in
[`docs/design-history.md`](../docs/design-history.md).
